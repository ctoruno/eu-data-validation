    It's worth emphasizing that people's perceptions consistently decrease negatively when compared to the data collected in 2017. 
    Additionally, there are substantial differences with other sources such as Freedom House. 
    It's important to keep in mind that we are highlighting the disparities we have found in our analysis, but there may be some changes that should be flagged even if they lack statistical significance. 
    Therefore, we recommend a comprehensive review of other pillars while considering the year, accuracy, and source of comparison.

    <br>   
    Finally, we suggest that the qualitative research should focus on the aforementioned aspects of the Rule of Law.
