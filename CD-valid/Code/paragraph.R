    It's worth emphasizing that people's perceptions consistently decrease negatively when compared to the data collected in 2017. 
    Additionally, there are substantial differences with other sources such as Freedom House. 
    It's important to keep in mind that we are highlighting the disparities we have found in our analysis, but there may be some changes that should be flagged even if they lack statistical significance. 
    Therefore, we recommend a comprehensive review of other pillars while considering the year, accuracy, and source of comparison.
    <br>  
    <br>   
    Finally, we suggest that the qualitative research should focus on the aforementioned aspects of the Rule of Law. We believe that other red flags found during the validation did not show a consistent pattern or the comparison points were not recent enough or sufficiently comparable to concern us.

    <li>Significant improvements were observed in Media Freedom (q39b_G1), Freedom of Speech (q39e_G2), and Open Government (q3c and q3a).</li>

    <li>Contrarily, the pretest data consistently exhibited lower scores than the TPS comparison indicators concerning Working Conditions (q45c_G1 and q45c_G2), Access to Justice (q44d_G2 and q44e_G2), and the Performance of Prosecutors (q43f_G2).</li>
