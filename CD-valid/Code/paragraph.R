            We are seeing that across time, a few pillars are indicating changes. Most only have one or two indicators, however pillar 2 has 16 comparisons. Although many of these have red flags, some are positive changes while others are negative changes and overall encompass experience and opinion questions. In comparison to the TPS public opinion polls, we only have 2 red flags. This indicates that our data is in accordance with other population surveys, which is one of the most important goals. In terms of the TPS expert surveys, there are a few pillars flagged, however we are conscious that we trust these scores less.

            <br>
            Given that we expect to see large changes from our previous data in Bulgaria, we are noting sub pillars that are flagged in both the GPP and TPS analyses. In this regard, all the topics that are flagged in the time comparison but supported by green flags in the TPS are considered as something normal in the context of Bulgaria Therefore, what we are highlighting are the discrepancies found in the data in two aspects: the ones that are consistent in both analyses, and also the ones that are not supported by another analysis.

            <ul>
            <li> When we asked how safe people feel walking in their neighborhood at night, we found a score of 0.664 when our previous score was 0.52. Although the difference between scores is not very large, the t-test indicates that overall, individuals are answering more positively than before. 
            </li>

            <li> Positive trend in 5.2: Absence of crime and violence </li>
            <ul>
            <li> When we asked if people were aware of organized crime occuring in their neighborhoods, we found a score of 0.935, while the average criminality score in the Organized Crime Index was 0.483. Although the comparison is from a low match, the concepts are still related and therefore we should give context about organized crime rates. </li>

            <br>
            We are seeing that across time, all of the pillars in the GPP are changing. For the most part, these changes indicate more negative opinions about the rule of law with some positive trends in select sub pillars. Nevertheless, the result of these trends in terms of our full fieldwork data are similar to what other sources are observing. Therefore, according to our data, people in Hungary have a decreased view of the rule of law, which is in accordance with the third party source data.
            <br>
            <br>
            Given that we expect to see changes from our previous data in Hungary, we are noting sub pillars that are flagged in the TPS analyses. In this regard, all the topics that are flagged in the time comparisson but supported by green flags in the TPS are considered as something normal in the context of Hungary. Therefore, what we are highlighting are the discrepancies found in the data in two aspects: the ones that are consistent in both analyses, and also the ones that are not supported in the TPS.

            <li> When we asked if people thought that workers‚Äô freedom to form labor unions and negotiate with employers is important, we found a score of 0.46 when our previous score was 0.61. Additionaly, when we asked if working conditions are favorable, we found a score of 0.36 while the European Social Survey found a score of 0.74 in 2021. These large discrepancies should be investigated through context about both unionization and working conditions. </li>
            </ul>
            </ul>

            <li> Negative trend in 7.1: Legal Security </li>
            <ul>
            <li> When we asked if people are aware of their rights when they face a legal problem we found an score of 0.34, while the Fundamental Rights Survey shows a score of 0.758 when they asked about the views on authorities providing information for people in a simple way. The large discrepancy between these scores should be explained further. Since this source of comparison is a low match, we recommend to give a context about the knowledge of people about their rights when they faced a legal problem. </li>
            </ul>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li> Negative trend in 8.7: Prisons </li>
            <ul>
            <li> When we asked how confident people are that the criminal justice system guarantees the safety and human rights of people deprived of their liberty, we found a score of 0.47, while Varieties of Democracy found a score of 0.835 when they asked if there was freedom from torture. Although the questions have a low match, they are still related and should be complemented with research about safety and human rights in the criminal justice system. </li>

            The topic areas highlighted above are what our data is telling us through the given analyses. However, it is still important to take into account the media reports and other qualitative background research to potentially identify any other sub-pillar that should be researched more thoroughly.

            <br>
            We are seeing that across time, most of the pillars are not changing drastically over time or indicate discrepancies with the TPS Public Opinion Polls. Pillar 1 is flagged in the GPP Over Time, however there is only one indicator level analysis and it is an opinion question. Pillar 8 is flagged in the TPS Expert Surveys, however the analyses have medium to low matches. Therefore, according to our data, people in Luxembourg have a similar view of the rule of law as they did in 2021, which is in accordance with the third party source data. Certainly, the primary source disparity is with Freedom in the World, where certain variables yield significantly high scores. In such instances, we advise prioritizing a discussion on the validity of our scores rather than clarifying disparities between the sources.
            <br>
            <br>
            Given that we do not expect to see changes from our previous data in Luxembourg, we are noting sub pillars that are flagged in both the GPP and TPS analyses. In this regard, all the topics that are flagged in the time comparison but supported by green flags in the TPS are considered as something normal in the context of Luxembourg Therefore, what we are highlighting are the discrepancies found in the data in two aspects: the ones that are consistent in both analyses, and also the ones that are not supported in the TPS.

            <ul>
            <li> When we asked if people a hypothetical situation about a government official taking money for personal benefit, we found a score of 0.738 when our previous score was 0.653. This indicates that people think it is more likely that the official is punished appropriately. Although the difference between scores is not very large, the t-test indicates that overall, individuals are answering more positively than before. </li>

            <ul>
            <li> When we asked if people thought that the criminal justice system treats those accused as innocent until proven guilty, we found a score of 0.592 while Freedom in the World assigned a score of 1 for the question regarding if due process prevails in civil and criminal matters. The large discrepancy between these scores should be explained further. Since this source of comparison is includes a strict expert encoding, we recommend to give a context about the rights of the accused and due process. </li>

            <li> Negative trend in 7.1: Legal Security </li>
            <ul>
            <li> When we asked if people are aware of their rights when they face a legal problem we found a score of 0.438, while the Fundamental Rights Survey shows a score of 0.825 when they asked about the views on authorities providing information for people in a simple way. The large discrepancy between these scores should be explained further. Since this source of comparison is a low match, we recommend to give a context about the knowledge of people about their rights when they faced a legal problem. </li>

            <li> Negative trend in 8.6: Due process of law </li>
            <ul>
            <li> When we asked how confident people are that the criminal justice system guarantees a fair trial of all accused people, we found a score of 0.633, while Freedom in the World found a score of 1 when they asked if due process prevaisl in civil and criminal matters. In the same analysis identified in Sub Pillar 4.6, when we asked if people thought that the criminal justice system treats those accused as innocent until proven guilty, we found a score of 0.592 while Freedom in the World assigned a score of 1 for the question regarding if due process prevails in civil and criminal matters. Although these questions have low matches, they are still related and should be complemented with research about the rights of the accused and due process. </li>

Furthermore, when we asked if people thought that the criminal justice system provides victims of crime with the service and support they need, we found a score of 0.618 when our previous score was .579. Although this subpillar has a green flag in the TPS public opinion poll analysis, we are still flagging it because that green flag is the result of a low matched comparison and the previous GPP data is most updated. </li>
            <li> At the NUTS level, discrepancies are evident in the regions 'SK01: Bratislavsk√Ω kraj' and 'SK03: Stredn√© Slovensko', where the scores are significantly higher than the rest of the country. Finding further explanations for the improvements in these regions' criminal justice systems would better clarify the overall explanation.</li>

            The topic areas highlighted above are what our data is telling us through the given analyses. However, it is still important to take into account the media reports and other qualitative background research to potentially identify any other sub-pillar that should be researched more thoroughly.
